## 1.1 **Overview**

This project addresses the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simulated Annealing (SA) as the main metaheuristic algorithm, enhanced with two improvement methods:

- 2-OPT Local Search (integrated inside the Simulated Annealing loop to improve every accepted solution)

- Tabu Search Improvement (applied after SA)

The notebook includes full implementation, visualization, comparisons and optional user input.

# 1.2 **Dataset**

We used the berlin52 dataset from TSPLIB, and it was imported directly using a Kaggle link.
The dataset is loaded from an online source.

# 1.3 **Run the Algorithms**

**A. Run Simulated Annealing**

This is the main optimization algorithm in the project.

It generates the initial solution used by all improvement methods.

SA features:

*   Random initial route
*   Neighbor generation
*   Cooling schedule
*   Accepting worse moves to escape local minima
*   Produces a complete TSP tour

Outputs:
*   SA Best Distance
*   SA Best Route
*   Convergence plot

Robustness:

To evaluate the robustness of Simulated Annealing, multiple initial temperatures (T0 = 100, 200, 300) were tested.
Each temperature was executed for five independent runs to measure consistency.
Robustness was evaluated using the standard deviation of the results.
A lower standard deviation indicates a more stable configuration.
Based on the experiments, T0 = 100 provided the most robust performance and was selected for the remaining analysis.

**B. Run Tabu Search**

Tabu Search is used as an improvement AFTER Simulated Annealing.

It starts from SA’s best route:

best_route_tabu, best_distance_tabu, evolution_tabu = tabu_improve(best_route_sa, coords)

Outputs:
- Tabu-improved distance
- Improved route
- Tabu convergence curve
- Route visualization

**C. 2-OPT Local Search**

2-OPT is a local improvement algorithm applied after Simulated Annealing.
It removes crossing edges and shortens the route.

How it works:
- Takes the SA route as input
- Reverses sub-paths to reduce total distance
- Repeats until no further improvement is possible

Outputs:
- 2-OPT improved distance
- Improved route visualization

**C. Comparison Section**
The notebook compares:

- SA only
- SA + 2-OPT
- SA + Tabu

It prints all distances and identifies which method is best.
A bar chart is also generated.

# **4. User Input **

The user can enter the number of cities and then enter x,y coordinates for each city.
The program then runs SA, SA+2OPT and SA+Tabu on the user’s data.

# **5. Outputs**

The notebook displays:

Best route (for SA, SA+2opt, SA+Tabu)

Best distances

Convergence curves

2D route visualizations

Comparison plots

# 2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)

## 2.1 **Overview**

This project also uses the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  
GA is a population-based evolutionary optimization method inspired by natural selection.  
It improves candidate solutions (routes) over multiple generations using:

- Selection  
- Crossover  
- Mutation  

The GA implementation focuses on generating high-quality TSP tours through controlled evolution, visualizing results, and comparing performance with SA.

---

## 2.2 **Dataset**
The Genetic Algorithm uses the same **berlin52** dataset from TSPLIB to ensure consistency with the SA experiments.  
The dataset includes 52 city coordinates, which are converted into an Euclidean distance matrix used to evaluate each tour.


## 2.3 **Run the Algorithm**

**A. Run Genetic Algorithm**

GA features:

*   Random initial population  
*   Fitness evaluation based on route distance  
*   Tournament selection  
*   Order-based crossover  
*   Swap mutation  
*   Produces a complete TSP tour  

Outputs:

*   GA Best Distance  
*   GA Best Route  
*   Convergence plot  

Robustness:

To improve the reliability of GA results, different parameter combinations  
(population size, mutation rate, generations) can be tested.  
Stable configurations can be chosen based on consistent performance across runs.

---

## 2.4 Parameter Fine-Tuning

To improve the performance and stability of the Genetic Algorithm, several parameter combinations were tested.  
The tuning process focused on identifying configurations that consistently produced strong solutions across multiple runs.

The following GA parameters were varied during experimentation:

- Population Size (e.g., 30, 50, 80)
- Number of Generations (e.g., 200, 300, 500)
- Mutation Rate (e.g., 0.01, 0.02, 0.05)
- Crossover Rate
- Tournament Size

Each parameter set was executed multiple times to evaluate consistency.  
Performance was assessed based on:

- Best distance achieved
- Average performance
- Stability across repeated runs

Through fine-tuning, parameter values that provided **more reliable and higher-quality solutions** were selected for the final GA configuration used in this project.

---

## 2.5 **Outputs**

The GA implementation displays:

- Best route  
- Best distance  
- Convergence curve (best fitness per generation)  
- 2D visualization of the final tour
