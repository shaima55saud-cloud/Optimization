# Metaheuristic Optimization Project (CS1463)

This project implements and compares two metaheuristic algorithms — **Simulated Annealing (SA)** and **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** — to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  
Prepared as part of the CS1463 course at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University.

## 1. **Overview**

This project solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Simulated Annealing (SA) as the main metaheuristic algorithm and two improvement methods:

- 2-OPT Local Search (integrated inside the Simulated Annealing loop to improve every accepted solution)

- Tabu Search Improvement (applied after SA)

The notebook includes full implementation, visualization, comparisons and optional user input.

# 2. **Dataset**

We used the berlin52 dataset from TSPLIB, and it was imported directly using a Kaggle link.
The dataset is loaded from an online source.

# **3. Run the Algorithms**

**A. Run Simulated Annealing**

This is the main optimization algorithm in the project.

It generates the initial solution used by all improvement methods.

SA features:

*   Random initial route
*   Neighbor generation
*   Cooling schedule
*   Accepting worse moves to escape local minima
*   Produces a complete TSP tour

Outputs:
*   SA Best Distance
*   SA Best Route
*   Convergence plot

Robustness:

To evaluate the robustness of Simulated Annealing, multiple initial temperatures (T0 = 100, 200, 300) were tested.
Each temperature was executed for five independent runs to measure consistency.
Robustness was evaluated using the standard deviation of the results.
A lower standard deviation indicates a more stable configuration.
Based on the experiments, T0 = 100 provided the most robust performance and was selected for the remaining analysis.

**B. Run Tabu Search**

Tabu Search is used as an improvement AFTER Simulated Annealing.

It starts from SA’s best route:

best_route_tabu, best_distance_tabu, evolution_tabu = tabu_improve(best_route_sa, coords)

Outputs:
- Tabu-improved distance
- Improved route
- Tabu convergence curve
- Route visualization

**C. 2-OPT Local Search**

2-OPT is a local improvement algorithm applied after Simulated Annealing.
It removes crossing edges and shortens the route.

How it works:
- Takes the SA route as input
- Reverses sub-paths to reduce total distance
- Repeats until no further improvement is possible

Outputs:
- 2-OPT improved distance
- Improved route visualization

**C. Comparison Section**
The notebook compares:

- SA only
- SA + 2-OPT
- SA + Tabu

It prints all distances and identifies which method is best.
A bar chart is also generated.

# **4. User Input **

The user can enter the number of cities and then enter x,y coordinates for each city.
The program then runs SA, SA+2OPT and SA+Tabu on the user’s data.

# **5. Outputs**

The notebook displays:

Best route (for SA, SA+2opt, SA+Tabu)

Best distances

Convergence curves

2D route visualizations

Comparison plots

# 🟩 2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)

## Overview

The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is an evolutionary optimization algorithm inspired by natural selection.  
In this project, GA is used to generate approximate solutions for the TSP by evolving a population of candidate tours over multiple generations.

### Key GA Features:
- Random initial population  
- Fitness evaluation using total route distance  
- Tournament selection  
- Order-based crossover  
- Swap mutation  
- Tracking of the best route and convergence curve

## How to Run GA

If using a script (e.g., `ga.py`):

```bash
python ga.py berlin52.tsp
