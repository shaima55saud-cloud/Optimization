# Metaheuristic Optimization for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
CS467 – Course Project

---

## Project Description
This project aims to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using two metaheuristic optimization algorithms:

- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)

The main goal is to compare the performance of both algorithms in terms of:
- Solution quality (tour distance)
- Convergence behavior
- Execution time

A standard benchmark dataset is used, and each algorithm is executed using predefined stopping conditions to ensure a fair and consistent comparison.

## Problem Overview: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem.  
Given a set of cities and the distances between them, the objective is to find the **shortest possible tour** that:

- Visits each city exactly once
- Returns to the starting city

TSP is classified as an **NP-hard problem**, meaning that finding the exact optimal solution becomes very difficult as the number of cities increases. Therefore, metaheuristic algorithms are commonly used to find good approximate solutions within reasonable time.
